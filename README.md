The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Run the code
To see the project, run the code "Projet_titanic.ipynb". 

## Models 
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest.
4. K Nearest Neighbors.
5. Support vector machine.
6. Gaussian Naive bayes.

## Metric 
The metric used to evaluate the quality of the model is 'Accuracy.

**Accuracy :**  One of the more obvious metrics, it is the measure of all the correctly identified cases. It is most used when all the classes are equally important.
